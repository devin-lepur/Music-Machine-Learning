# Music-Machine-Learning
(Very early stage development) Machine learning algorithm to determine if I, Devin Lepur, like or would like a song. 
It will take in a .csv file that is from a spotify playlist that I make. The specifics of the songs in that playlist
are currently under review to ensure accuracy. The .csv file will use "Exportify" to download the playlist along
with a number of added variables to help the model be more accurate.
